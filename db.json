      "description": "The Soviet Union was a notoriously closed Society until Stalin's Death in 1953. Then, in the mid-1950s, a torrent of Western novels, films, and Paintings invaded Soviet streets and homes, acquiring heightened emotional significance. To See Paris and Die is a History of this momentous opening to the West. At the heart of this History is a process of translation, in which Western Figures took on Soviet roles: Pablo Picasso as a political rabble-rouser; Rockwell Kent as a quintessential American painter; Erich Maria Remarque and Ernest Hemingway as teachers of love and courage under fire; J. D. Salinger and Giuseppe De Santis as saviors from Soviet cliches. Imported novels challenged fundamental tenets of Soviet ethics, while modernist Paintings tested deep-seated notions of culture. Western films were eroticized even before viewers took their seats. The Drama of cultural exchange and translation encompassed discovery as well as loss. Eleonory Gilburd explores the pleasure, longing, humiliation, and anger that Soviet citizens Felt as they found themselves in the midst of this cross-cultural encounter. The main protagonists of To See Paris and Die are small-town teachers daydreaming of faraway places, college students vicariously discovering a wider world, and factory engineers striving for self-improvement. They invested Western imports with political and Personal significance, transforming foreign texts into intimate belongings. With the end of the Soviet Union, the Soviet West disappeared from the cultural map. Gilburd's History reveals how domesticated Western imports defined the last three decades of the Soviet Union, as well as its Death and afterlife.",

Kennedy to Donald J. Trump—have sought the counsel of Henry Kissinger, a brilliant diplomat and historian whose unprecedented achievements as a negotiator have been universally acknowledged. Now, for the first time, Kissinger the Negotiator provides a clear analysis of Kissinger’s overall approach to making deals and resolving conflicts—expertise that holds powerful and enduring lessons.James K. Sebenius (Harvard Business School), R. Nicholas Burns (Harvard Kennedy School of Government), and Robert H. Mnookin (Harvard Law School) crystallize the key elements of Kissinger’s approach, based on in-depth interviews with the former secretary of state himself about some of his most difficult negotiations, an extensive study of his record, and many independent sources. Taut and instructive, Kissinger the Negotiator mines the long and fruitful career of this elder statesman and shows how his strategies apply not only to Contemporary diplomatic challenges but also to other realms of negotiation, including business, public policy, and Law. Essential reading for current and Future leaders, Kissinger the Negotiator is an invaluable guide to reaching agreements in challenging situations.",

He has studied the science behind it, and worked closely with high performers across business, Sports and entertainment, to understand what it takes to transcend apparent limitations and achieve true potential.Through his entrepreneurial experience and studying the field of health and fitness, Bansal came to understand the enormous power of plasticity: the ability of the human brain to rewire itself at will as we develop new skills. He also realised that high performers across domains rely on common tools that were embraced by ancient wisdom and are validated by modern science. Knowing that high performance is not a matter of Genetics or luck is highly empowering. No Limits distils Bansal’s findings on talent, deliberate practice, mindset, habit, willpower and learning. It is a guide to maximising one’s potential with well-defined strategies. So, no matter what you do, you can be a superior version of yourself, performing at increasingly better levels, constantly reaching higher.",

      "description": "Niet-exclusief vrouwelijk Viagra-overzicht Het gebruik van Sildenafil Citraat (een functionerend segment in Lady Era-pillen) voor mannelijke seksuele gebrokenheid duurt nog erg lang. In ieder geval heeft de toepassing ervan bij vrouwen in deze tijd een kolossale vraag gehad. De laatste tijd heeft de farmaceutische markt veel generieke Sildenafil-generieke geneesmiddelen ingebracht voor damesgebruik. Hoe het functioneert? Het onderdeel van het werk van vrouwelijke niet-exclusieve Viagra is als zijn activiteit bij mannen. Het onderscheid in fysiologie tussen mensen heeft echter invloed op de effecten van de remedie op beide geslachten. De Viagra-tablet komt in de maag en desintegreert en bereikt binnen 30-uur het hoogtepunt van zijn levensvatbaarheid. Sildenafil zorgt voor het afwikkelen van de aderen die de bekkenorganen aansporen. Daarom vertoont de stroom bloed naar het territorium tekenen van verbetering waardoor vrouwelijke geslachtsorganen steeds kwetsbaarder worden voor ophitsing. Evenzo dient de opname van conventionele Viagra-pillen om: - Verbeter de olie van de vrouwelijke persoonlijke zones; - Verminder kwellende sensaties en ongemak te midden van seks; - Bereik de piek sneller; - Enkele hoogtepunten binnen één geslacht; - Vergroot seksueel verlangen. Het is algemeen gebruik In tegenstelling tot mannen, die Viagra-pillen nemen om een erectie te krijgen, gebruiken vrouwen de oplossing om hun verlangen naar geslachtsgemeenschap te vergroten en hun privézones steeds ontvankelijker voor opwinding te maken. Bovendien worden niet-exclusieve Viagra-pillen regelmatig gebruikt door vrouwen die een kind hebben voortgebracht of die in de richting van de menopauze komen. Beide klassen vrouwelijke patiënten kunnen problemen hebben die verband houden met vaginale droogheid. Het ontbreken van olie veroorzaakt echt ongemak of zelfs pijn tussen de geslachtsgemeenschap. Beheersing van niet-exclusieve Sildenafil kan de omstandigheid verbeteren, aangezien deze regeling zijn levensvatbaarheid heeft aangetoond bij de verbetering van de zalfolie. Voortaan kunnen dames zich enorm verbeterd voelen tijdens het gebruik van de medicatie. Veranderingen in de fysieke indruk van seks leiden tot enthousiaste mensen. Op het moment dat de dames de procedure waarderen, wordt hun drang hoger omdat seksuele betrekkingen nooit meer verbonden zijn met angst of leed. Onvoorstelbare bijwerkingen Sildenafil Citraat zou de reden kunnen zijn voor een aantal lichte tot directe antagonistische reacties. Ernstige symptomen zijn in hoge mate ongewoon en beïnvloeden over het algemeen de personen die bepaalde contra-indicaties hebben voor Viagra. Om het licht en de meeste hebben af en toe aangekondigde negatieve reacties op de genezing een plaats: - Hoofdpijn; - Verstopping van de neus; - Diarree; - Vermoeidheid; - Doorspoelen van het gezicht. Deze zijn allemaal kort en verdwijnen binnen twee of drie uur nadat de activiteit van het medicijn is ingepakt. Niettegenstaande, in het geval dat u geïrriteerd bent door de duur van de bijwerkingen of deze verslechteren, moet u uw leverancier van menselijke diensten ter discussie stellen.",

Under the mentorship of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr Singh was at the helm of affairs in the state for eighteen years, successively as regent, Sadar-i-Riyasat and governor.This carefully conceived selection of over 200 letters exchanged between Dr Singh and Pandit Nehru sheds light on significant issues and events, including the teething problems of a fledgling country and a newly grafted state, the emerging conflicts between Pakistan and India, and the Chinese aggression of 1962. In addition to valuable insights into the political situation of the period, these letters also provide rare glimpses into the personal lives and thoughts of Pandit Nehru and Dr Singh. The memorandum submitted by Maharaja Hari Singh to President Rajendra Prasad in August 1952 is published in full, revealing how the identity and future of Kashmir were shaped.A rare collection, Jammu and Kashmir offers an unmatched ringside view of the momentous events in Kashmir and the rest of India after Independence.",

      "description": "At the summit of his power, John Law was the most famous man in Europe. Born in Scotland in 1671, he was convicted of murder in London and, after his escape from prison, fled Scotland for the mainland when Union with England brought with it a warrant for his arrest. On the continent he lurched from one money-making scheme to the next - selling insurance against losing lottery tickets in Holland, advising the Duke of Savoy - amassing a fortune of some £80,000.But for his next trick he had grander ambitions. When Louis XIV died, leaving a thoroughly bankrupt France to his five-year-old heir, Law gained the ear of the Regent, Philippe D'Orleans. In the years that followed, Law's financial wizardry transformed the fortunes of France, enriching speculators and investors across the continent, and he was made Controller-General of Finances, effectively becoming the French Prime Minister. But the fall from grace that was to follow was every bit as spectacular as his meteoric rise.John Law, by a biographer of Adam Smith and the author of Frozen Desire and Capital of the Mind, dramatises the life of one of the most inventive financiers in history, a man who was born before his time and in whose day the word millionaire came to be coined.",

In addition to the book, the Disney+ team was on hand to capture stories along the way. A full-length documentary and 52 short-form episodes expand the profiles and delve deeper into the essence of what it's like to be a Disney cast member. On a Thursday in 2019, a small army of photographers and videographers scattered across the globe to capture what goes on beyond those tantalizing 'Cast Members Only' doors - whether eavesdropping on historic endeavors or typical tasks. All the photos in this book were taken on that single Thursday, beginning early in Tokyo and following the sun around the world through Shanghai, Hong Kong, Paris, Madrid, the Bahamas, Costa Rica, and dozens of places throughout the United States. More than 40 hours after it began, the day ended as the sun set on the Aulani resort in Hawaii. On that day, some 80 Cast Members agreed to open up their workshops, dressing rooms, kitchens, cubicles, TV studios, labs, locomotive engines - and some even more surprising and diverse work spaces. They also shared their stories: childhood dreams and chapters, career pivots and triumphs, workaday hurdles and joys. It was just a day in the life, as extraordinary as any other day at Disney. As any Cast Member can tell you, a Disney job is less a destination than a limitless journey. And for just One Day at Disney, we can all tag along for the ride.",

The NCCN guidelines and high impact journals were also referenced as and when needed. The result is this book, which will serve the purpose of equipping the exam going (NEET-SS and board review, along with any other entrance exam where questions about Oncology are asked) doctors with the right tool to test and build their knowledge.As the knowledge in the field of Oncology is unfolding at an unprecedented scale and new strategies are being devised at a prolific pace, it is not possible to provide all of the updated information, all at once. I will be updating this book periodically for this purpose and I would implore readers to keep themselves updated by going through the quarterly updates of DeVita's Oncology that are included with the purchase of the 11th edition and also the NCCN guidelines.In case of any queries and suggestions regarding this book, kindly send to: bhratri@gmail.comDr. Bhratri Bhushan MBBS, MD (Internal medicine), DM (Medical Oncology) is a consultant medical oncologist and hematologist.

      "description": "The Soviet Union was a notoriously closed Society until Stalin's Death in 1953. Then, in the mid-1950s, a torrent of Western novels, films, and Paintings invaded Soviet streets and homes, acquiring heightened emotional significance. To See Paris and Die is a History of this momentous opening to the West. At the heart of this History is a process of translation, in which Western Figures took on Soviet roles: Pablo Picasso as a political rabble-rouser; Rockwell Kent as a quintessential American painter; Erich Maria Remarque and Ernest Hemingway as teachers of love and courage under fire; J. D. Salinger and Giuseppe De Santis as saviors from Soviet cliches. Imported novels challenged fundamental tenets of Soviet ethics, while modernist Paintings tested deep-seated notions of culture. Western films were eroticized even before viewers took their seats. The Drama of cultural exchange and translation encompassed discovery as well as loss. Eleonory Gilburd explores the pleasure, longing, humiliation, and anger that Soviet citizens Felt as they found themselves in the midst of this cross-cultural encounter. The main protagonists of To See Paris and Die are small-town teachers daydreaming of faraway places, college students vicariously discovering a wider world, and factory engineers striving for self-improvement. They invested Western imports with political and Personal significance, transforming foreign texts into intimate belongings. With the end of the Soviet Union, the Soviet West disappeared from the cultural map. Gilburd's History reveals how domesticated Western imports defined the last three decades of the Soviet Union, as well as its Death and afterlife.",

      "description": "Niet-exclusief vrouwelijk Viagra-overzicht Het gebruik van Sildenafil Citraat (een functionerend segment in Lady Era-pillen) voor mannelijke seksuele gebrokenheid duurt nog erg lang. In ieder geval heeft de toepassing ervan bij vrouwen in deze tijd een kolossale vraag gehad. De laatste tijd heeft de farmaceutische markt veel generieke Sildenafil-generieke geneesmiddelen ingebracht voor damesgebruik. Hoe het functioneert? Het onderdeel van het werk van vrouwelijke niet-exclusieve Viagra is als zijn activiteit bij mannen. Het onderscheid in fysiologie tussen mensen heeft echter invloed op de effecten van de remedie op beide geslachten. De Viagra-tablet komt in de maag en desintegreert en bereikt binnen 30-uur het hoogtepunt van zijn levensvatbaarheid. Sildenafil zorgt voor het afwikkelen van de aderen die de bekkenorganen aansporen. Daarom vertoont de stroom bloed naar het territorium tekenen van verbetering waardoor vrouwelijke geslachtsorganen steeds kwetsbaarder worden voor ophitsing. Evenzo dient de opname van conventionele Viagra-pillen om: - Verbeter de olie van de vrouwelijke persoonlijke zones; - Verminder kwellende sensaties en ongemak te midden van seks; - Bereik de piek sneller; - Enkele hoogtepunten binnen één geslacht; - Vergroot seksueel verlangen. Het is algemeen gebruik In tegenstelling tot mannen, die Viagra-pillen nemen om een erectie te krijgen, gebruiken vrouwen de oplossing om hun verlangen naar geslachtsgemeenschap te vergroten en hun privézones steeds ontvankelijker voor opwinding te maken. Bovendien worden niet-exclusieve Viagra-pillen regelmatig gebruikt door vrouwen die een kind hebben voortgebracht of die in de richting van de menopauze komen. Beide klassen vrouwelijke patiënten kunnen problemen hebben die verband houden met vaginale droogheid. Het ontbreken van olie veroorzaakt echt ongemak of zelfs pijn tussen de geslachtsgemeenschap. Beheersing van niet-exclusieve Sildenafil kan de omstandigheid verbeteren, aangezien deze regeling zijn levensvatbaarheid heeft aangetoond bij de verbetering van de zalfolie. Voortaan kunnen dames zich enorm verbeterd voelen tijdens het gebruik van de medicatie. Veranderingen in de fysieke indruk van seks leiden tot enthousiaste mensen. Op het moment dat de dames de procedure waarderen, wordt hun drang hoger omdat seksuele betrekkingen nooit meer verbonden zijn met angst of leed. Onvoorstelbare bijwerkingen Sildenafil Citraat zou de reden kunnen zijn voor een aantal lichte tot directe antagonistische reacties. Ernstige symptomen zijn in hoge mate ongewoon en beïnvloeden over het algemeen de personen die bepaalde contra-indicaties hebben voor Viagra. Om het licht en de meeste hebben af en toe aangekondigde negatieve reacties op de genezing een plaats: - Hoofdpijn; - Verstopping van de neus; - Diarree; - Vermoeidheid; - Doorspoelen van het gezicht. Deze zijn allemaal kort en verdwijnen binnen twee of drie uur nadat de activiteit van het medicijn is ingepakt. Niettegenstaande, in het geval dat u geïrriteerd bent door de duur van de bijwerkingen of deze verslechteren, moet u uw leverancier van menselijke diensten ter discussie stellen.",

Under the mentorship of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr Singh was at the helm of affairs in the state for eighteen years, successively as regent, Sadar-i-Riyasat and governor.This carefully conceived selection of over 200 letters exchanged between Dr Singh and Pandit Nehru sheds light on significant issues and events, including the teething problems of a fledgling country and a newly grafted state, the emerging conflicts between Pakistan and India, and the Chinese aggression of 1962. In addition to valuable insights into the political situation of the period, these letters also provide rare glimpses into the personal lives and thoughts of Pandit Nehru and Dr Singh. The memorandum submitted by Maharaja Hari Singh to President Rajendra Prasad in August 1952 is published in full, revealing how the identity and future of Kashmir were shaped.A rare collection, Jammu and Kashmir offers an unmatched ringside view of the momentous events in Kashmir and the rest of India after Independence.",

Born in Scotland in 1671, he was convicted of murder in London and, after his escape from prison, fled Scotland for the mainland when Union with England brought with it a warrant for his arrest. On the continent he lurched from one money-making scheme to the next - selling insurance against losing lottery tickets in Holland, advising the Duke of Savoy - amassing a fortune of some £80,000.But for his next trick he had grander ambitions. When Louis XIV died, leaving a thoroughly bankrupt France to his five-year-old heir, Law gained the ear of the Regent, Philippe D'Orleans. In the years that followed, Law's financial wizardry transformed the fortunes of France, enriching speculators and investors across the continent, and he was made Controller-General of Finances, effectively becoming the French Prime Minister. But the fall from grace that was to follow was every bit as spectacular as his meteoric rise.John Law, by a biographer of Adam Smith and the author of Frozen Desire and Capital of the Mind, dramatises the life of one of the most inventive financiers in history, a man who was born before his time and in whose day the word millionaire came to be coined.",

A full-length documentary and 52 short-form episodes expand the profiles and delve deeper into the essence of what it's like to be a Disney cast member. On a Thursday in 2019, a small army of photographers and videographers scattered across the globe to capture what goes on beyond those tantalizing 'Cast Members Only' doors - whether eavesdropping on historic endeavors or typical tasks. All the photos in this book were taken on that single Thursday, beginning early in Tokyo and following the sun around the world through Shanghai, Hong Kong, Paris, Madrid, the Bahamas, Costa Rica, and dozens of places throughout the United States. More than 40 hours after it began, the day ended as the sun set on the Aulani resort in Hawaii. On that day, some 80 Cast Members agreed to open up their workshops, dressing rooms, kitchens, cubicles, TV studios, labs, locomotive engines - and some even more surprising and diverse work spaces. They also shared their stories: childhood dreams and chapters, career pivots and triumphs, workaday hurdles and joys. It was just a day in the life, as extraordinary as any other day at Disney. As any Cast Member can tell you, a Disney job is less a destination than a limitless journey. And for just One Day at Disney, we can all tag along for the ride.",

The NCCN guidelines and high impact journals were also referenced as and when needed. The result is this book, which will serve the purpose of equipping the exam going (NEET-SS and board review, along with any other entrance exam where questions about Oncology are asked) doctors with the right tool to test and build their knowledge.As the knowledge in the field of Oncology is unfolding at an unprecedented scale and new strategies are being devised at a prolific pace, it is not possible to provide all of the updated information, all at once. I will be updating this book periodically for this purpose and I would implore readers to keep themselves updated by going through the quarterly updates of DeVita's Oncology that are included with the purchase of the 11th edition and also the NCCN guidelines.In case of any queries and suggestions regarding this book, kindly send to: bhratri@gmail.comDr. Bhratri Bhushan MBBS, MD (Internal medicine), DM (Medical Oncology) is a consultant medical oncologist and hematologist. He has published a number of Books on the subject of Oncology and his papers have been published in renowned journals of medical literature.",
